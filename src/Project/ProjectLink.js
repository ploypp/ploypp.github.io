                My teammate and I started by defining the scope of targeted user groups to be  senior citizens and disabled elderly. Since many elderly are living by themselves and may not be familiar with smart home technology, we decided to focus on usability and functionality to provide them with easy and accessible experiences through our app.

                Because of the time constraint, I conducted a competitive analysis to gain insights about common features and feedback from the users of current smart home apps in the market.

              <p>
                Firstly, we decided to think about necessary features that our app should have, mainly considering desirability and accessibility. Our selected features include the smartboard that shows devicesâ€™ current status, devices malfunction alert, electricity usage, voice commands, and smart devices connector.

              <p>
                After that, I sketched the user interface of the app with all the functions above. The sketches helped me see a rough picture of how the app should look like. My teammate and I also critiqued the sketches together to make them more complete and look clearer for the next step, design.

                For the primary and secondary colors used in the app, I decided to use the combination of beige and navy with white as a supportive color. The contrast of beige and navy makes texts and buttons easily readable, and these two colors also work well with both light and dark themes.

                The font I chose for the whole design is SF Pro Text. I decided to go with Sans Serif font because it is easier to read on a phone screen.

              <p>
                Because I only had a week to finish this project, I carefully looked at each little detail before moving to the next step because it would waste more time to come back and fix anything. I also gained problem-solving and decision-making skills from working independently on the interactive prototype. However, having a teammate who I could ask for opinions also benefited in finalizing the design choices.
