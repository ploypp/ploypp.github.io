Consistently being indoors and the inability to exercise with people inside urged participants to find an alternative location to improve their mental and physical health.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"wrapper\">\n            <div className=\"col2-start process\">\n              <span>04.

According to that, we would like to understand how people’s sense of safety is influenced by different types of exercise or types of exercise companions, as well as people’s most important personal and social motivators to exercise.\n              </p>\n              <ul>\n                <li>How is people’s sense of safety influenced by different types of exercise?

We compared the responses regarding mask wearing and social distancing. From the chart, most people tend to do endurance exercise, and it is not possible to compare them fairly. However, we see that most people found it harder to wear a mask while exercising.\n              </p>\n              <img src=\"img/waparks/chart2.png\" alt=\"Reasons of Following Guidelines Regarding Safety by Type of Exercise\"/>\n              <p className=\"img-caption\">People wanted to make themselves and others feel safe by following guidelines.</p>\n              <p>\n                This second chart shows the reason why people follow the guidelines, and we can see that most people want to make themselves and others feel safe regardless of exercise types\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                From the findings, we made an implication that wearing a mask can cause trouble while exercising, so less people do that although they prioritize their safety and other’s safety. It also confirms our interview finding that people choose not to wear a mask since it’s hard to breathe, and elaborates on the field research about why people follow the guidelines. However, we cannot assume which types of exercise influence the most because the responses are from a small number of people and they tend to do more endurance exercise.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"wrapper\">\n            <div className=\"col2-start process\">\n              <span>05.

Parks can provide stopping points as an option along paths (six feet apart) for runners to take off their mask and catch their breath if needed.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"wrapper\">\n            <div className=\"col2-start process\">\n              <span>06.
